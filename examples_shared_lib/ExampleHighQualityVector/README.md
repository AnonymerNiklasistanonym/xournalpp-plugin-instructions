# ExampleSharedLibraryObject

This plugin links to Cairo and LibrSVG to load a vector image (`.svg`) and rasterizes it with a much higher resolution than GTK normally does.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This only works on the Xournal++ nightly build at the moment since it makes use of the plugin API `app.addImages`.
